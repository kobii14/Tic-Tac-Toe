The Whatever player plays by random choices by given random numbers. The program chooses 2 random numbers in
 a valid range and checks if the place is available.
 The clever player plays with a strategy of filling in rows first and by that it can win much more that
 the Whatever player.
 The snartypamts player is the smartest and he is blocking all of the ways to victory of the clever player,
 and also wins at the most of the games against Whatever player.
